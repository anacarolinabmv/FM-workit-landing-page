## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

This is my first project using Sass, as opposed to pure CSS, therefore I chose an easy challenge to work with. Working with Sass made writing CSS pretty easey and stright forwardm due to is nesting properties. However, I reckon I have still have a lot to laern, precisely regarding writing and organizing media queries and the architecture of the sass files.
